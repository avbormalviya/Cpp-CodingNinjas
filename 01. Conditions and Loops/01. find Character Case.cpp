Problem statement
Write a program that takes a character as input and prints 1, 0, or -1 according to the following rules.


1, if the character is an uppercase alphabet (A - Z).
0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z).
-1, if the character is not an alphabet.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1 :
v

Sample Output 1 :
0

Explanation of Sample Input 1:
The input character is lowercase, so our answer is 0.


Sample Input 2 :
V

Sample Output 2 :
1


Explanation of Sample Input 2:
The input character is uppercase, so our answer is 1.


Sample Input 3 :
#

Sample Output 3 :
-1

Explanation of Sample Input 3:
The input character is not an alphabet, so our answer is -1.


Constraints :
The input can be any single character.


Hint:
Can you check in which range of characters ‘CH’ lie to check its type?
